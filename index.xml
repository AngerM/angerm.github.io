      <description>Today we are going to talk about how to design your system. A lot of posts and articles have been written about this, and I wanted to throw my opinion out there as well.
So how do you build a scalable system for your startup?
A lot of startups decide to go with one of the standard monolith/all-in-one frameworks for their projects, for example Ruby-on-Rails or Django. The allure of these systems is quite understandable.</description>

      <description>Hello!
Welcome to my personal blog. I am a software engineer with over 15 years of industry experience and have worked with an extremely diverse array of companies, from enterprise data center systems to small consumer startups. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at scale on data center switches pushing multiple Tbps and AdTech systems handing &amp;gt;1M QPS. Hopefully some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along the way can be helpful to others.
Enjoy your stay!</description>
